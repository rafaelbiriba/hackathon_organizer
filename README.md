## Prerequisites

- Go to `Create credentials` > `Oauth Client ID` > `Web Application`
- Fill the information of your website url and your website oauth callback (Examples: http://example.com and http://example.com/auth/google_oauth2/callback)
- Extra step: Don't forget to add HTTP and HTTPS urls if this is your scenario.

## Installation

### Development Notes

#### Switching Users

Only for development environment, you can easily switch users using `?user=<id>` at the url. This will switch the logged user on-the-fly. (Example: `http://localhost:3000/projects?user=3`)

#### Populating the Database

The file `seed.rb` is responsible to populate the database with a lot of dummy data. You can use this to create an functional application and test things around. You can run it using `rake db:seed`
